# Catch-Me
An android game created by using Unity

The Game is a 2D top-down motion game.

You have a white character moved with the joystick.

Our main character wins the game when it catches all the blue and red characters.

The red ones move to random points on the map and when the main character gets closer than a certain distance, they move in the opposite direction. As our main character chases, their speed decrease.

Blue characters can't move, but they throw white balls at random intervals. If our main character touches these balls, we lose the game. Also, both of our characters are spammed in random frequencies.
